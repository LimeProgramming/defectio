Event Reference
---------------

This section outlines the different types of events listened by :class:`Client`.

There are two ways to register an event, the first way is through the use of
:meth:`Client.event`. The second way is through subclassing :class:`Client` and
overriding the specific events. For example: ::

    import defectio

    class MyClient(defectio.Client):
        async def on_message(self, message):
            if message.author == self.user:
                return

            if message.content.startswith('$hello'):
                await message.channel.send('Hello World!')

If an event handler raises an exception, :func:`on_error` will be called
to handle it, which defaults to print a traceback and ignoring the exception.

.. warning::

    All the events must be a |coroutine_link|_. If they aren't, then you might get unexpected
    errors. In order to turn a function into a coroutine they must be ``async def``
    functions.

.. function:: on_ready()

    Called when the client is done preparing the data received from Revolt. Usually after login is successful.

    .. warning::

        This function is not guaranteed to be the first event called.
        Likewise, this function is **not** guaranteed to only be called
        once. This library implements reconnection logic and thus will
        end up calling this event whenever a RESUME request fails.

.. function:: on_error(event, *args, **kwargs)

    Usually when an event raises an uncaught exception, a traceback is
    printed to stderr and the exception is ignored. If you want to
    change this behaviour and handle the exception for whatever reason
    yourself, this event can be overridden. Which, when done, will
    suppress the default action of printing the traceback.

    The information of the exception raised and the exception itself can
    be retrieved with a standard call to :func:`sys.exc_info`.

    If you want exception to propagate out of the :class:`Client` class
    you can define an ``on_error`` handler consisting of a single empty
    :ref:`raise statement <py:raise>`. Exceptions raised by ``on_error`` will not be
    handled in any way by :class:`Client`.

    :param event: The name of the event that raised the exception.
    :type event: :class:`str`

    :param args: The positional arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.
    :param kwargs: The keyword arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.

.. function:: on_socket_raw_receive(msg)

    Called whenever a message is received from the WebSocket, before
    it's processed. This event is always dispatched when a message is
    received and the passed data is not processed in any way.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages received from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param msg: The message passed in from the WebSocket library.
                Could be :class:`bytes` for a binary message or :class:`str`
                for a regular message.
    :type msg: Union[:class:`bytes`, :class:`str`]

.. function:: on_socket_raw_send(payload)

    Called whenever a send operation is done on the WebSocket before the
    message is sent. The passed parameter is the message that is being
    sent to the WebSocket.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages sent from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param payload: The message that is about to be passed on to the
                    WebSocket library. It can be :class:`bytes` to denote a binary
                    message or :class:`str` to denote a regular text message.

.. function:: on_typing(channel, user, when)

    Called when someone begins typing a message.

    The ``channel`` parameter can be a :class:`abc.Messageable` instance.
    Which could either be :class:`TextChannel`, :class:`GroupChannel`, or
    :class:`DMChannel`.

    If the ``channel`` is a :class:`TextChannel` then the ``user`` parameter
    is a :class:`Member`, otherwise it is a :class:`User`.

    :param channel: The location where the typing originated from.
    :type channel: :class:`abc.Messageable`
    :param user: The user that started typing.
    :type user: Union[:class:`User`, :class:`Member`]
    :param when: When the typing started as a naive datetime in UTC.
    :type when: :class:`datetime.datetime`

.. function:: on_message(message)

    Called when a :class:`Message` is created and sent.

    .. warning::

        Your bot's own messages and private messages are sent through this
        event. This can lead cases of 'recursion' depending on how your bot was
        programmed. If you want the bot to not reply to itself, consider
        checking the user IDs.

    :param message: The current message.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_message_delete(message)

    Called when a message is deleted. If the message is not found in the
    internal message cache, then this event will not be called.
    Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic servers.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_delete` event instead.

    :param message: The deleted message.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_raw_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a message is deleted. Unlike :func:`on_message_delete`, this is
    called regardless of the message being in the internal message cache or not.

    If the message is found in the message cache,
    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageDeleteEvent.cached_message`

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageDeleteEvent`

.. function:: on_message_edit(before, after)

    Called when a :class:`Message` receives an update event. If the message is not found
    in the internal message cache, then these events will not be called.
    Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic servers.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_edit` event instead.

    The following non-exhaustive cases trigger this event:

    - The message content has been changed.

    :param before: The previous version of the message.
    :type before: :class:`Message`
    :param after: The current version of the message.
    :type after: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_raw_message_edit(payload)

    Called when a message is edited. Unlike :func:`on_message_edit`, this is called
    regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    If the message is found in the message cache,
    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message`. The cached message represents
    the message before it has been edited. For example, if the content of a message is modified and
    triggers the :func:`on_raw_message_edit` coroutine, the :attr:`RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message`
    will return a :class:`Message` object that represents the message before the content was modified.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageUpdateEvent`

.. function:: on_private_channel_delete(channel)
              on_private_channel_create(channel)

.. function:: on_server_channel_delete(channel)
              on_server_channel_create(channel)

.. function:: on_server_remove(server)
